### AGILE METHODOLOGY 
------
This kanban based on the agile methodology approach is a visual representation of all the tasks, that comprised of main epic stories each with their own set of user stories. These were to be completed in order to finish the project successfully:
![KANBAN](/static/images/validation/kanban.png)

### Epic Stories and User Stories breakdown

### **Epic 1: Event Browsing and Discovery**
As an attendee, I want to easily browse, search, and discover events so that I can find the ones Iâ€™m most interested in and plan my participation.

| **Issue Number** | **User Story**                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| #1               | As an attendee, I want to view a list of upcoming events so that I can decide which event to attend. |
| #2               | As an attendee, I want to view the details of a specific event so that I can learn more about it. |
| #5               | As an attendee, I want to search for specific events by category or status so that I can speed up my search. |
| #7               | As an attendee, I want to see the event capacity and status so that I know if I can still register. |

### **Epic 2: Event Registration and Management for Attendees**
As an attendee, I want to manage my event registrations so that I can track my commitments and make changes as needed.

| **Issue Number** | **User Story**                                                                 |

### **Epic 3: Event Creation and Management for Organisers**
As an organiser, I want to create, manage, and oversee my events so that I can engage attendees and ensure successful event execution.

| **Issue Number** | **User Story**                                                                 |

| #9               | As an organiser, I want to view a list of all events Iâ€™ve created so that I can manage them efficiently. |
| #10              | As an organiser, I want to update the event details so that I can reflect any changes. |
| #11              | As an organiser, I want to delete an event that is no longer happening so that attendees can be notified. |
| #12              | As an organiser, I want to view a list of people who have registered for an event so I can see and contact who is attending. |

### **Epic 4: Event Search and Analysis for Organisers**
As an organiser, I want to search and analyse event data so that I can track trends, compare events, and improve my offerings.

| **Issue Number** | **User Story**                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| #14              | As an organiser, I want to search and filter events based on status, date, or category and organiser, so that I can analyse potential competitors. |

As an admin, I want to oversee and moderate all events on the platform so that I can ensure high-quality and appropriate event entries.

| **Issue Number** | **User Story**                                                                 |

### TESTING

#### RESPONSIVENESS

Using bootstrap comes with a lot of predetermined website responsiveness on all devices. I also implemented some custom responsiveness using media queries - this has resulted in all templates being responsive.
